# Driving Directions
1. Steering is controlled via position mouse instead of keyboard. This creates better angles for training. Note the angle is based on the mouse distance. To steer hold the left mouse button and move left or right. To reset the angle to 0 simply lift your finger off the left mouse button.
2. You can toggle record by pressing R, previously you had to click the record button (you can still do that).
3. When recording is finished, saves all the captured images to disk at the same time instead of trying to save them while the car is still driving periodically. You can see a save status and play back of the captured data.
4. You can takeover in autonomous mode. While W or S are held down you can control the car the same way you would in training mode. This can be helpful for debugging. As soon as W or S are let go autonomous takes over again.
5. Pressing the spacebar in training mode toggles on and off cruise control (effectively presses W for you).
6. Added a Control screen
7. Track 2 was replaced from a mountain theme to Jungle with free assets , Note the track is challenging
8. You can use brake input in drive.py by issuing negative throttle values
